# Defs

## Page Table
A data structure used in computer operating systems to manage virtual memory. It maps virtual addresses to physical addresses, enabling the operating system to translate virtual memory accesses into physical memory accesses.

## Entry
In the context of a page table, an entry refers to a specific record in the page table that contains information such as the mapping between virtual and physical addresses.

## UMA (Uniform Memory Access)
A memory architecture in which the access time to all memory locations in the computer's physical memory is equal. This means that each processor in a multi-processor system has the same access time to any memory location.

## Physical Frame Address
The actual location in the computer's physical memory (RAM) where a specific piece of data is stored.

## Shared Memory Page
A portion of physical memory that can be accessed by multiple processes or threads concurrently. It allows processes to communicate and share data efficiently.

## Virtual Memory Address
Addresses used by programs or applications, which are translated by the operating system into physical memory addresses via the page table.

## Process Structure
A data structure in the operating system that stores information about a specific process, such as its process ID, program counter, stack pointer, and state.

## Page Size (PGSIZE)
A global variable representing the size of a page in virtual memory. Commonly set to 4 kilobytes (4k) in many operating systems.

## Nondeterministic
Refers to the unpredictable behavior in a system, such as the order in which programs will execute. Nondeterministic systems do not follow a specific pattern and can produce different outcomes each time they are run.

## Mutual Exclusion Lock
A synchronization primitive used to prevent multiple threads or processes from accessing shared resources simultaneously. It ensures that only one thread or process can execute a specific section of code at a time, preventing data corruption and race conditions.

## Hardware Instruction
Low-level operations executed directly by the computer's hardware. Instructions like "test and set" are atomic operations, meaning they are executed without interruption and are not affected by other operations.

## Lock Holder
The thread or process that currently holds a lock and has exclusive access to the associated resource.

## Mutex
Short for "mutual exclusion," a mutex is a synchronization object that provides mutual exclusion to shared resources. Threads or processes can acquire the mutex to access the shared resource and release it when they are done.

## Scheduling Session
A period during which the operating system's scheduler decides which processes or threads should run next. Scheduling sessions help manage the execution of multiple processes efficiently.

## Spin Lock
A type of lock where a thread continuously polls the lock until it becomes available. While simple and efficient in some cases, spin locks can waste CPU cycles if the lock is held for an extended period.

## Yield (Operating System Function Call)
A system call that voluntarily gives up the CPU, allowing other processes or threads to run. Yielding is a way for processes to cooperate, enabling multitasking and preventing monopolization of system resources.

## Guard Lock
A synchronization mechanism used to protect critical sections of code from concurrent access. Guard locks ensure that only one thread can enter a specific section of code at a time.

## Flag Variable
A variable used as a signaling mechanism between threads or processes. Threads can check the flag variable to determine if a certain condition is met before proceeding with their execution.

## Park Function
A system function that places a process in a waiting queue until a specific condition is met. It is often used for synchronization purposes, allowing processes to wait until they can proceed safely.

## Test and Set
An atomic hardware instruction that tests a memory location and sets it to a new value in a single operation. It is commonly used to implement locks and other synchronization primitives.

## Scheduler
The component of the operating system responsible for determining the order in which processes or threads are executed. The scheduler aims to optimize system performance by efficiently allocating CPU time to various tasks.

## Wait Lock
A synchronization mechanism that allows a thread to wait until a specific condition is met. Threads can acquire a wait lock and release it when the condition they are waiting for becomes true.

## XState Variable
A variable used to represent the state of a specific resource or condition in a system. XState variables are often used in synchronization mechanisms to coordinate the activities of multiple threads or processes.

## Init
A short form of "initialize," commonly used in programming to indicate the process of setting initial values or configurations for variables and data structures.

## Proc Structure (Process Structure)
A data structure in the operating system kernel that contains information about a specific process, including its program counter, stack pointer, and other relevant data.

## Process Structure Address
The memory address where the process structure is stored in the operating system's kernel. It allows the operating system to access and modify information about a specific process.

## Context Switch
The process of saving the current state of a running process and loading the state of another process, allowing multitasking and the efficient use of CPU resources in a multiprogramming environment.

## Acquire Function
A function used to acquire a lock or synchronization primitive, allowing a thread or process to gain exclusive access to a shared resource.

## Pop Off Function
A function that removes an element from a data structure, often used in stack or queue operations.

## Sleep Function
A system call or function that puts a process or thread to sleep, suspending its execution for a specified period or until a specific event occurs. Sleeping processes do not consume CPU resources.

## Wakeup Function
A system call or function that wakes up a sleeping process or thread, allowing it to resume execution after being suspended by a sleep operation.

## Push Off Function
A function that adds an element to a data structure, often used in stack or queue operations.

## Wait Function
A system call or function that causes a process to wait until a specific condition is met. In the context of child processes, the wait function waits for a child process to terminate and returns its exit status.

## How to Measure a Lock:
- **Mutual Exclusivity:** Check if the lock ensures that only one thread or process can access the protected resource at any given time. A lock is mutually exclusive if it prevents concurrent access by multiple threads.
  
- **Fairness:** Evaluate if the lock provides fairness, meaning that threads or processes are granted access in the order they request it. A fair lock ensures that no thread is indefinitely starved of access.
  
- **Efficiency:** Assess how efficiently the lock operates. An efficient lock minimizes the time threads spend waiting for access and avoids unnecessary CPU cycles. Factors like the lock's implementation and the time threads spend waiting influence its efficiency.

Remember that choosing the right synchronization mechanism and evaluating these factors are crucial for the performance and reliability of concurrent programs in operating systems.
